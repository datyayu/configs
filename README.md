# Configs
A repo for saving my usual config files so I don't have to redo all the work everytime I feel like powerwashig my chromebook.

Includes
  - <b>makefile</b>: A quick installing file for my usual tools.
  - <b>packages.sh</b>: Used inside makefile for install rails & some npm packages.
  - <b>.zshrc.sh</b>: My zsh config.
  - <b>.tmux.conf</b>: My tmux config.
  - <b>Package Control.sublime-settings</b>:  Includes the packages I like to install on sublime (Not that I really use them all).
  - <b>Preferences.sublime-settings</b>:  My settings for working on sublime.
